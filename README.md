# AVL_Tree_C
AVL Tree in C

# What is a BST (Binary Search Tree)
-> a tree where the left children are less / equal to the root and right children are greater than the root
-> can search through tree my doing simple compare operations
-> do not have (if balanced) to search every node to find / not find node
-> height dependent min: log(n) max: n 

# AVL Trees
-> type of BST that is always height balanced
-> balance factor = (hl - hr) needs to be {-1,0,1}
-> have to rotate after every insertion and bubble after every deletion

# Rotations
-> always done on 3 nodes
-> only 4 types LL, LR, RR, RL
-> Using only clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations (see notes)
